# Database Improvements Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Database Backup
- Created backup script at `infrastructure/db/backup_db.py`
- Successfully backed up database to `infrastructure/db/backups/tothub_backup_20250805_165207.sql`
- Backup size: 211,576 bytes
- Verified as valid PostgreSQL dump

### ✅ Task 2: Schema Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation at `infrastructure/db/db_schema.md`
- Documented all 37 tables with columns, types, and relationships
- Identified issues and improvement areas

### ✅ Task 3: Schema Normalization
- Added missing `parent_id` column to `children` table
- Created foreign key constraint from `children` to `parents`
- Total foreign key constraints in database: 26

### ✅ Task 4: Performance Indexes
- Created indexes for frequently queried fields:
  - `idx_attendance_date` and `idx_attendance_child_date`
  - `idx_security_logs_timestamp`
  - `idx_messages_recipient_id` and `idx_messages_sender_id`
  - Additional indexes for schedules, documents, alerts, and billing

### ✅ Task 5: Security Enhancements
- Fixed severity values in alerts table
- Added check constraint for severity values
- Added audit columns (`last_modified`, `modified_by`) to `security_credentials`
- Created trigger to auto-update `last_modified` on changes
- Total check constraints: 204

### ✅ Task 6: Data Quality
- Added default values for enrollment dates and active status
- Added archive columns for soft deletes
- Created indexes for active record queries

### ⚠️ Task 7: Seed Data (Partially Complete)
- Successfully seeded 5 user profiles
- Need to adapt seed script for actual table structures
- Some tables have different column names than expected

## Database Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tables | 37 |
| Foreign Key Constraints | 26 |
| Performance Indexes | 3+ |
| Check Constraints | 204 |

## Tables with Foreign Keys Added

1. `children` → `parents` (parent_id)
2. `attendance` → `children` (existing)
3. `billing` → `children` (existing)
4. `child_schedules` → `children` (existing)
5. Various security, document, and payroll relationships

## Performance Improvements

### Indexes Created
- Attendance queries by date and child
- Session activity by timestamp
- Security logs by timestamp
- Messages by sender/recipient
- Documents by expiration date
- Billing by status and due date

### Query Optimization
These indexes will significantly improve:
- Daily attendance lookups
- Session tracking and analytics
- Security audit trails
- Message inbox queries
- Document expiry monitoring
- Billing status reports

## Security Improvements

1. **Audit Trail**: Added automatic tracking of modifications to security credentials
2. **Data Validation**: Check constraints ensure data integrity
3. **Soft Deletes**: Archive columns allow data recovery
4. **Prepared for Encryption**: Structure ready for credential hashing implementation

## Remaining Work

1. **Complete Seed Data**: Adapt seed script to match actual table structures
2. **Hash Security Credentials**: Implement bcrypt hashing for PINs and passwords
3. **Prune Empty Tables**: Review and potentially remove truly unused tables
4. **Additional Indexes**: Add more based on query performance monitoring

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Backups**: Schedule daily backups using the created script
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries
3. **Security Audit**: Regular review of security_logs table
4. **Data Cleanup**: Periodic archival of old session_activity records
5. **Index Maintenance**: Regular `REINDEX` operations for optimal performance
