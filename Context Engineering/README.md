# Context Engineering - Moved to Global Installation

Context Engineering has been moved to a global installation at:
```
~/.context-engineering/
```

This allows you to use Context Engineering commands and templates across all your projects, not just TotHub.

## Using Context Engineering Commands

The PRP commands are still available:
- `/generate-prp` - Generate a Product Requirements Prompt
- `/execute-prp` - Execute a PRP to implement features

## Benefits of Global Installation
- Use Context Engineering in any project
- Share templates and patterns across projects
- Consistent development methodology everywhere
- Works alongside Agent OS global installation
