# TotHub Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in TotHub, a daycare management system handling sensitive data including child information, biometrics, payroll, and compliance records.

## Security Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

#### 1. Data Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for sensitive data at rest
- **TLS 1.3** for data in transit (production deployment)
- **Biometric data hashing** - templates stored as irreversible hashes, not raw data
- **Password hashing** using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Secure token generation** using crypto.randomBytes()

#### 2. Access Controls
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with admin, manager, staff, parent roles
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** support:
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
  - SMS/Email verification codes
  - Backup codes
  - Hardware token support via WebAuthn
- **Session management** with secure token generation
- **API key validation** for external integrations

#### 3. Input Validation & Security Headers
- **XSS protection** with input sanitization
- **CSRF protection** with token validation
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
- **Security headers** via Helmet.js:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options

#### 4. Audit & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all security events
- **Real-time suspicious activity detection**
- **Automated security alerts** for high-risk events
- **Compliance audit trails** for COPPA, GDPR, CCPA, FERPA, HIPAA

#### 5. Privacy Compliance
- **Multi-regulation compliance framework**:
  - COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
  - GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
  - CCPA/CPRA (California Privacy Acts)
  - FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
  - HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Consent management system**
- **Data retention policies**
- **Right to deletion** (GDPR Article 17)
- **Data portability** (GDPR Article 20)

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Username/password authentication
2. MFA challenge (if enabled)
3. Session token generation
4. Role-based access enforcement
5. Audit logging of all events

### Data Protection Layers
1. **Application Layer**: Input validation, CSRF protection
2. **Transport Layer**: TLS encryption
3. **Storage Layer**: AES-256 encryption
4. **Access Layer**: RBAC, MFA
5. **Audit Layer**: Comprehensive logging

### Biometric Security
- Face recognition data stored as mathematical descriptors
- Fingerprint data stored as hashed templates
- No raw biometric images retained
- Confidence scoring for authentication quality
- Secure enrollment and verification processes

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas Addressed
- ✅ Child PII protection with COPPA compliance
- ✅ Biometric data security with irreversible hashing
- ✅ Financial data protection for payroll systems
- ✅ Physical security integration with encrypted credentials
- ✅ Multi-state compliance framework

### Medium-Risk Areas
- ⚠️ **Database backup encryption** - Ensure backups are encrypted
- ⚠️ **Key rotation policies** - Implement regular encryption key rotation
- ⚠️ **Incident response automation** - Automate breach detection responses

### Low-Risk Areas
- ℹ️ **Third-party integrations** - QuickBooks API uses OAuth
- ℹ️ **Mobile app security** - Future mobile development considerations

## Compliance Status

### COPPA (Children Under 13)
- ✅ Parental consent mechanisms
- ✅ Limited data collection
- ✅ No behavioral advertising
- ✅ Secure data deletion
- ✅ Annual policy reviews

### GDPR (EU Residents)
- ✅ Lawful basis for processing
- ✅ Data subject rights implementation
- ✅ Breach notification procedures (72-hour rule)
- ✅ Privacy by design principles
- ✅ Data Protection Impact Assessments

### CCPA/CPRA (California)
- ✅ Consumer rights implementation
- ✅ Data sale prohibition
- ✅ Transparent privacy policies
- ✅ Opt-out mechanisms

### FERPA (Educational Records)
- ✅ Educational record protection
- ✅ Directory information controls
- ✅ Annual notification requirements

### HIPAA (Health Information)
- ✅ PHI safeguards
- ✅ Business associate agreements
- ✅ Breach notification procedures
- ✅ Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
- Real-time monitoring of audit logs
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity
- User reporting mechanisms
- Regular security scans

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate containment** (within 1 hour)
2. **Impact assessment** (within 4 hours)
3. **Stakeholder notification** (within 24 hours)
4. **Regulatory notification** (within 72 hours - GDPR)
5. **Public disclosure** (if required by law)

### Recovery Actions
- System isolation and patching
- Password reset enforcement
- Access token revocation
- Security control reinforcement

## Security Testing Recommendations

### Penetration Testing
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Scope**: Web application, APIs, authentication
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Professional
- **Areas**: SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Frequency**: Weekly automated scans
- **Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS, or similar
- **Coverage**: Network, web application, dependencies

### Code Review
- **Static analysis**: ESLint security rules, SonarQube
- **Dependency scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Secret detection**: GitLeaks, TruffleHog

## Implementation Checklist

### Environment Variables Required
```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<64-character-hex-key>
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql-connection-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<32-character-random-string>
MFA_ISSUER=TotHub
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=HIGH
```

### Production Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
